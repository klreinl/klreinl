Welcome! My name is Kait Reinl and I am a limnologist with a broad focus on how the synergistic effects of climate and watershed influence impacts inland water quality. My most recent work has focused on cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Superior using monitoring, experimental, and computer modeling approaches. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [University of Wisconsin-Madison's](https://www.wisc.edu/) [Center for Limnology](https://limnology.wisc.edu/) advised by [Hilary Dugan](https://dugan.limnology.wisc.edu/) and [Noah Lottig](http://www.noahlottig.com/)/[Emily Stanley](https://stanley.limnology.wisc.edu/). I am working remotely from Hibbing, MN for this position.

During my time there I worked on a variety of projects as an udergraduate including assissting in the review and application of the lake model â€˜FLake', programming a CR 1000 Basic Datalogger with LI-COR 7500 to record air quality data, sampling Torch Lake for trace metals, analytes, DOC, and suspended solids, snow core sampling, and conducting stream assessments. As a master's student I utilized climate model data to model future temperature conditions in small lakes in the Midwest. I went on to complete my PhD at the [University of Minnesota - Duluth's](d.umn.edu) [Large Lakes Observatory](https://scse.d.umn.edu/large-lakes-observatory) with [Bob Sterner](https://cbs.umn.edu/sterner-lab). There I worked on many projects (learn more on the [Research](https://klreinl.github.io/klreinl/page2) page), but the theme of my dissertation work was the intersection of climate, watershed, influence, and phytoplankton dyanmics in Lake Superior. 


I have two border collies named Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton, 6 laying hens, and currently reside in northern Minnesota. Some of my hobbies include XC skiing, reading, fishing, and hiking.
