Welcome! My name is Kait Reinl and I am a limnologist with a broad focus on how the synergistic effects of climate and watershed influence impacts inland water quality. My most recent work has focused on cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Superior using monitoring, experimental, and computer modeling approaches. I am currently the Research Coordinator for the Lake Superior [National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR)](https://lakesuperiornerr.org/), which is part of the [University of Wisconsin-Madison Division of Extension](https://extension.wisc.edu/). In this position, I serve as the lead scientist and guide the research program for the Reserve.

During my time there I worked on a variety of projects as an undergraduate including assisting in the review and application of the lake model ‘FLake’, programming a CR1000 Basic Datalogger with LI-COR 7500 to record air quality data, sampling Torch Lake for trace metals, analytes, DOC, and suspended solids, snow core sampling, and conducting stream assessments. As a master’s student I utilized climate model data to model future temperature conditions in small lakes in the Midwest.  I went on to complete my PhD at the [University of Minnesota - Duluth's](d.umn.edu) [Large Lakes Observatory](https://scse.d.umn.edu/large-lakes-observatory) with [Bob Sterner](https://cbs.umn.edu/sterner-lab). There I worked on many projects (learn more on the [Research](https://klreinl.github.io/klreinl/page2) page), but the theme of my dissertation work was the intersection of climate, watershed, influence, and phytoplankton dynamics in Lake Superior. After completing my PhD, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [University of Wisconsin-Madison's](https://www.wisc.edu/) [Center for Limnology](https://limnology.wisc.edu/) advised by [Hilary Dugan](https://dugan.limnology.wisc.edu/) and [Noah Lottig](http://www.noahlottig.com/)/[Emily Stanley](https://stanley.limnology.wisc.edu/). During that time I work on a variety of projects including developing the LAGOS US database, projects on lake phenology, and coordinating efforts to understand the ecology of Lake Superior's nearshore.
