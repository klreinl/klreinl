# Research Interests

Most of the earth's freshwater is frozen. In fact, less than **1.5%** is liquid and found on the surface, and this water is not distributed evenly around the globe. As the effects of climate change and human activity continue to degrade water quality, even less of that water is available for use by humans and many other organisms that rely on clean water for survival. Some of these threats include invasive species, toxic pollutants, nutrient pollution and eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and restructured ecosystems. It is of vital importance that we protect and manage our freshwater resources for today and future generations.

Alhtough the threats listed above, and others not listed, are unique and important challenges, my work braodly focuses on how climate and watershed infleunces impact freshwater quality. I have tackled these questions using diverse approaches including field monitoring, experimental work, and computer modeling. My work to date has primarily focused on how climate and watersheds shape phytoplankton dyanmics in lakes, with an emphasis on cyanobacterial blooms. I've done work on these topics in small inland lakes as well as Lake Superior. I am also interested the role of streams in lake water quality, how organic nutrients affects phtyoplankton community structure and function, and integrating field and laboratory data with new modeling techniques.
