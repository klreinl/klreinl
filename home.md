Welcome! My name is Kait Reinl and I am a limnologist with a broad focus on how the synergistic effects of climate and watershed influence impacts inland water quality. My most recent work has focused on cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Superior using monitoring, experimental, and computer modeling approaches. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [University of Wisconsin-Madison's](https://www.wisc.edu/) [Center for Limnology](https://limnology.wisc.edu/) advised by [Hilary Dugan](https://dugan.limnology.wisc.edu/) and [Noah Lottig](http://www.noahlottig.com/)/[Emily Stanley](https://stanley.limnology.wisc.edu/).
